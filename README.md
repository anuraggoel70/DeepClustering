# DeepClustering
This repository contains the code for DDLK and DDLS algorithms of deep clustering.

The benchmark models used in our research work are DCEC (Deep Clustering with Convolutional Autoencoders), DKM (Deep K-Means), DCN (Deep Clustering Network) and Auto-Encoder + k-Means (AEKM).

Code for DCEC is referred from: https://github.com/XifengGuo/DCEC


Code for DKM, DCN, AEKM are referred from: https://github.com/MaziarMF/deep-k-means

Besides this, the baseline KMeans algorithm and Sparse Subspace Clustering algorithm are used. The code for KMeans is also referred from https://github.com/MaziarMF/deep-k-means.

The three datasets used in our research are:
1. EYaleB processed dataset
2. ARFaces
3. COIL20
